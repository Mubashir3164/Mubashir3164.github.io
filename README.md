Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This repository hosts my professional portfolio, showcasing my expertise in bioinformatics, computational biology, and molecular research. The site is powered by GitHub Pages and is designed to provide a comprehensive view of my skills, projects, and academic contributions.

## About Me

I am **Mubashir Abbas**, a PhD graduate in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow**. My research expertise spans a wide range of computational and experimental biology disciplines. 

### Key Expertise:
- **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Data Analysis**: Variant calling, genome assembly, and transcriptomics.
- **Population Genetics**: Leveraging genomic data to study genetic diversity and population dynamics.
- **Functional Genomics**: Exploring root systems and plant stress responses.
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Proficient in **Linux**, **Python**, and **R** for high-throughput data analysis.
- **Postdoctoral Research Focus**: Combining population genetics, transcriptomics, pangenomics, transposable elements, DNA methylation, and single-cell analysis to unravel mechanisms of plant disease resistance.

## Projects and Tutorials

My portfolio includes tutorials and projects in:
- NGS data processing and analysis.
- Customized bioinformatics pipelines for variant annotation.
- Advanced R and Python scripts for data visualization and statistics.
